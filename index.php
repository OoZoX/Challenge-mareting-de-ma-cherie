                        <p>Our team is composed of students from the Gaming Business School of Lyon and Paris. During a challenge given by our school we have to gather students from both campuses, in order to assemble our skills and knowledge acquired during the year for a two day marketing challenge.
                            The project consists in creating a mobile game with the theme: "games of our
                            childhood". Our mission is to create the game and to do all the marketing and communication aspects.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>
                            To start this challenge we first had to find the game. We did a brainstorming with our group where we listed all the ideas of games that we played at recess. We then chose to take a typical game: "Poule Renard Vipère".
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>
                            Then we decided to change the game by making it our own. So we changed the Poule Renard Vipère to elves, dwarfs and orcs. So we are in a medieval fantasy world. The game has for genre RPG, MOBA, Battle Royal.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>
                            The gameplay of our game is the Orcs attack Dwarfs, Dwarfs attack Elves and Elves attack Orcs. There are NPCs all around the maps, collect them so they join your team. They will fight the NPC’s enemy team. The player can grab enemies NPC, and they will have to bring them to his base, same for NPCs fighting with each other. Once NPC are in the enemy base, the original owner player will have 1:30 to unleash them before they join the enemy team. You can collect resources to upgrade your base, your NPCs and much more! There are plenty of customizable skins to fit your tastes.
                        </p>

                            All in all, designing a mobile game is a process that takes a lot of time, creativity, and effort, but it can also be very rewarding. By sharing our design process for our latest mobile game, we hope to have inspired you and given you some insight into what it takes to create a fun and successful game. We are proud of our latest mobile game and look forward to continuing to explore new concepts to create even more incredible gaming experiences. We hope you enjoy our game as much as we enjoyed designing and developing it. Thank you for your support!
